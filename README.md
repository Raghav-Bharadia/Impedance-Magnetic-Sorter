# Impedance-Magnetic-Sorter

It will sort material based on certain properties into different storage boxes. In my case i did it based on magnetic properties.

First of all get all the required parts:

You can get all the material for the above using the following links:

2 x Dc Motor --> https://a.co/d/hThEPPq

1 x L298 Motor Driver --> https://a.co/d/6bdZdHH

1 x Arduino Uno --> https://a.co/d/2X68hMl

1 x 12v rechargable battery --> https://www.amazon.in/Lithium-Rechargeable-Battery-Industrial-Equipment/dp/B085BGY3NV/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=12%2Bv%2Bbattery&sr=8-6&th=1

As per need x Jumper wires --> https://a.co/d/9OpCN2D

1 x Hall Effect Sensor --> https://www.amazon.in/xcluma-sensor-Speed-Counting-Module/dp/B098QWW58Q/ref=sr_1_19?keywords=hall+effect+sensor&sr=8-19

1 x IR Sensor --> https://a.co/d/a8pLr5r

Now you will have to make a DIY model of a conveyor belt with a moving channel in the front.

for reference the setip should look something like this:

After that the connections for it can be done as shown in the schematics below:

Congratulations you have built your own Sorting bot using arduino uno.
